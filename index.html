      <h1>Chicago's Attractions & Virtual Tours</h1>
      <p>Chicago continues to be a place that many people from diverse backgrounds call home. Before it was a city (founded in 1830), it was the home to numerous indigenous peoples, a legacy which continues to frame our relationship with the city, the land, and the environment. Today, Chicago has become a global city, a thriving center of international trade and commerce, and a place where people of every nationality and background come to pursue the American dream. It is the largest city of the American Midwest. </p>
      <p>Chicago is home to many cultural institutions and museums. It is known for its architecture, with notable tall buildings and skyscrapers built before the mid-1930s. Some of these buildings are the Auditorium Building, the Chicago Cultural Center, the Chicago Building, the Wrigley Building, Tribune Tower, the Carbide & Carbon Building, the Merchandise Mart, and the Chicago Board of Trade Building. Aside from its architecture, Chicago is known for the invention or significant advancement of several performing arts, including improvisational comedy, house music, blues, hip hop, gospel, jazz, and soul.</p>
      <p>This website will explore Chicago, from a virtual perspective, and give you the opportunity to see it from your home before deciding to venture out and explore it in person. You will get to see the top museums and buildings, learn about the neighborhoods and its unique restaurants and culture.</p>
