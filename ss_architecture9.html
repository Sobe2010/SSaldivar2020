			<h2>One Prudential Plaza</h2>
			<p><em>One Prudential Plaza</em> (formerly known as the Prudential Building) is a 41-story structure in Chicago completed in 1955 as the headquarters 
		for Prudential's Mid-America company. It was the first skyscraper built in Chicago since the Great Depression of the 1930s and the Second World 
		War. At the time of the project’s conception, the site was a freight yard owned by the Illinois Central Railroad and required the use of air rights 
		to construct the building above the active railroad tracks. While the freight yards have since disappeared, passenger service remains for commuter 
		trains serving the South Side of Chicago, southern suburbs and Northern Indiana, with One Prudential Plaza offering direct access to the Millennium 
		Station located beneath street level. One Prudential Plaza was the last building ever connected to the Chicago Tunnel Company's tunnel network. When 
		the Prudential was finished it had the highest roof in Chicago with only the statue of Ceres on the Chicago Board of Trade higher. Its mast served as 
		a broadcasting antenna for Chicago's WGN-TV. The architect was Naess & Murphy.</p>
			<p>The façade of the mid-century building has hints of the previously popular Art Deco style, maintaining strong vertical lines of uninterrupted 
		limestone piers separated by bays of recessed windows set into aluminum spandrels. The main entrance is set back from Randolph Street with an entry 
		plaza flanked by two portions of the building’s lower floors that extend outward to the edges of the property. One of these extensions of the 
		building’s lower floorplates features a portion of the façade dedicated to a relief of the Rock of Gibraltar by artist Alfonso Iannelli, representing 
		the logo of the Prudential Company.</p>
