			<h2>The Fourth Presbyterian Church (Chicago)</h2>
			<p>The Fourth Presbyterian Church of Chicago is a congregation of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) located in the Magnificent Mile neighborhood of 
		Chicago, directly across Michigan Avenue from the John Hancock Center. The Fourth Presbyterian Church of Chicago was formed on February 12, 1871 by 
		the merger of Westminster Presbyterian Church and North Presbyterian Church. The combined congregation dedicated a new church building on Sunday, 
		October 8, 1871. The Great Chicago Fire began later that day and destroyed the young congregation's new sanctuary. The congregation subsequently built 
		a second building, located at the corner of Rush Street and Superior Street, which it dedicated February 1874. After nearly 40 years at that location, 
		in 1912, the congregation decided to construct a new building on Pine Street (now North Michigan Avenue), which was then a fairly undeveloped part of 
		the city. The congregation employed architect Ralph Adams Cram to create a Gothic Revival building. Cram, who also designed the Cathedral of St. John 
		the Divine in New York City, worked on both churches silmutaneously during 1912. Only Fourth Presbyterian was completed, however, and was dedicated in
		1914. In contrast, St. John the Divine is still officially unfinished and is considered a work in progress. Cram designed and built the sanctuary 
		however the parish house, cloister, manse, and garth, which lie to the south along Michigan Avenue, were designed by Howard Van Doren Shaw. The church 
		building is the oldest structure on North Michigan Avenue, with the exception of the Chicago Water Tower, and is listed on the National Register of 
		Historic Places.</p>
