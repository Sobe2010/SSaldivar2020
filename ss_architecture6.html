			<h2>The Tribune Tower</h2>
			<p>The <em>Tribune Tower</em> is a 470 feet (140 m) tall, 36 floor neo-Gothic skyscraper located at 435
			North Michigan Avenue in Chicago. Built between 1923 and 1925, the international design competition for the 
			tower became a historic event in 20th century architecture. The tower was the home of the Chicago Tribune, 
			Tribune Media, and Tribune Publishing. WGN Radio (720 kHz) originated broadcasts from the building until moving
			to 303 Wacker Drive in June, 2018. CNN's Chicago bureau was also located in the building. It is listed as a 
			Chicago Landmark. The original Tribune Tower was built in 1868, but was destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire in 
			1871. In early 2018, work began on converting the entire office building into condominiums, expected to be 
			completed by 2020.</p>
			<p>By 1922 the neo-Gothic skyscraper had become an established design tactic, with the first important 
			"American Perpendicular Style" at Cass Gilbert's Woolworth Building of 1913. Construction on the Tribune Tower 
			was completed in 1925. The ornate buttresses surrounding the peak of the tower are especially visible when the 
			tower is lit at night. The sculptures and decorations were made by the American artist Rene Paul Chambellan. 
			The tower features carved images of Robin Hood (Hood) and a howling dog (Howells) near the main entrance to 
			commemorate the architects. The top of the tower is designed after the Tour de beurre (″butter tower″) of the 
			Rouen Cathedral in France, which is characteristic of the Late-Gothic style, but with a crown-shaped top instead
			of a spire. Rene Paul Chambellan contributed his sculpture talents to the buildings ornamentation, gargoyles and
			the famous Aesops' Screen over the main entrance doors. Among the gargoyles on the Tribune Tower is one of a 
			frog. That piece was created by Chambellan to represent himself jokingly as he is of French ancestry.</p>
			<p>Prior to building the Tribune Tower, correspondents for the Chicago Tribune brought back rocks and bricks 
			from a variety of historically important sites throughout the world at the request of Colonel McCormick. Many of 
			these reliefs have been incorporated into the lowest levels of the building and are labeled with their location 
			of origin. Stones included in the wall are from such sites as the Taj Mahal, the Parthenon, Palace of Westminster,
			the Great Pyramid, The Alamo, Notre Dame de Paris, Abraham Lincoln’s Tomb, the Great Wall of China, the Berlin 
			Wall, the Rouen Cathedral's Butter Tower, which inspired the shape of the building, and many more. The column 
			fragment of Wawel Castle, located in its own niche over the upper-left corner of the main entrance, is a visual
			tribute to Chicago's large Polish population, the largest such presence outside of the Republic of Poland. A 
			piece of steel recovered from the World Trade Center has been added to the wall. There are 149 fragments in the
			building.</p>
