			<h2>The Rookery Building</h2>
			<p>The <em>Rookery Building</em> is a historic office building located in the Chicago Loop. Completed by architects 
		Daniel Burnham and John Wellborn Root of Burnham and Root in 1888, it is considered one of their masterpiece 
		buildings. The building is 181 feet (55 m) high, twelve stories tall, and is considered the oldest standing 
		high-rise in Chicago. It has a unique style with exterior load-bearing walls and an interior steel frame, 
		which provided a transition between accepted and new building techniques. By mixing modern building techniques, 
		such as metal framing, fireproofing, elevators and plate glass, together with traditional ones, such as brick 
		facades and elaborate ornamentation, Burnham and Root sought to create a bold architectural statement. Root drew 
		upon a variety of influences in designing the interior and exterior spaces, including Moorish, Byzantine, Venetian 
		and Romanesque motifs.</p>
			<p>The lobby was remodeled in 1905 by Frank Lloyd Wright. Beginning in 1989, the lobby was restored to the original 
		Wright design. The building was designated a Chicago Landmark on July 5, 1972 and listed as a National Historic Landmark 
		on May 15, 1975. The name of the building is an allusion to the temporary City Hall building that occupied the 
		land before it. That building was nicknamed the rookery not only in reference to the crows and pigeons that 
		flocked to its exterior, but also because of the alleged shady politicians it housed.</p>
