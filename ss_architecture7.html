			<h2>The Water Tower</h2>
			<p>The <em>Chicago Water Tower</em> is a contributing property and landmark in the Old Chicago Water 
			Tower District in Chicago, that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The tower is located at 
			806 North Michigan Avenue along the Magnificent Mile shopping district in the Near North Side community area 
			of Chicago in a small park, the Jane M. Byrne Plaza. The tower was constructed to house a large water pump, 
			intended to draw water from Lake Michigan. Built in 1869, it is the second-oldest water tower in the United 
			States, after the Louisville Water Tower in Louisville, Kentucky. The Chicago Water Tower now serves as a 
			Chicago Office of Tourism art gallery known as the City Gallery in the Historic Water Tower. It features the 
			work of local photographers and artists, and filmmakers.</p>
			<p>The tower, built in 1869 by architect William W. Boyington from yellowing Lemont limestone, is 182.5 feet 
			tall. Inside was a 138-foot high standpipe to hold water. In addition to being used for firefighting, the 
			pressure in the pipe could be regulated to control water surges in the area. Together with the adjacent 
			Chicago Avenue Pumping Station, it drew clean water from water cribs in Lake Michigan. The tower gained 
			prominence after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. While some incorrectly believe that the tower was the only 
			building to survive the fire, a few other buildings in the burned district survived along with the tower. The 
			tower was the only public building in the burned zone to survive, and is one of just a few of the surviving 
			structures still standing. In the years since the fire, the tower has become a symbol of old Chicago and of 
			the city's recovery from the fire. After the Chicago fire, the tower has undergone two renovations. The first 
			took place during a three-year period, 1913â€“1916. At that time many of the limestone blocks were replaced. 
			The second renovation occurred in 1978. This renovation consisted mostly of interior changes with only minor 
			changes made to the exterior of the building. The Water Tower's castle-like style inspired the design of some 
			White Castle restaurant buildings. The Tower was named an American Water Landmark in 1969.</p>
