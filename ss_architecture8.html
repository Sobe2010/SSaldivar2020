			<h2>The Willis Tower</h2>
			<p>The <em>Willis Tower</em> (formerly known as the Sears Tower until 2009) is a 110-story, 1,450-foot skyscraper in Chicago. At completion in 1973, 
			it surpassed the World Trade Center in New York City to become the tallest building in the world, a title that it held for nearly 25 years; it 
			was also the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere for 41 years, until the new One World Trade Center surpassed it in 2013. The Willis Tower
			is considered a seminal achievement for engineer Fazlur Rahman Khan and is currently the third-tallest building in the United States and the 
			Western hemisphere – and the 23rd-tallest in the world. Each year, more than one million people visit its observation deck, the highest in the 
			United States, making it one of Chicago's most popular tourist destinations. The structure was renamed in 2009 by the Willis Group as a 
			term of its lease.</p>
			<p>Sears, which needed 3 million square feet (280,000 m2) of office space for its planned consolidation and predicted growth, commissioned 
			architects Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM). The building was designed as a nine square "tubes" (each essentially a separate building), 
			clustered in a 3×3 matrix forming a square base with 225-foot (69 m) sides. All nine tubes would rise up to the 50th floor of the building, 
			where the northwest and southeast tubes terminate. The northeast and southwest tubes reach the 66th floor; the north, east, and 
			south tubes end at the 90th. The remaining west and center tubes reach 108 floors. The Sears Tower was the first building to use this innovative 
			design. It was both structurally efficient and economic. It provided more space and rose higher than the Empire State Building and cost much 
			less per unit area. The system would prove highly influential in skyscraper construction and has been used in most supertall buildings since, 
			including the world's current tallest building, the Burj Khalifa.</p>
