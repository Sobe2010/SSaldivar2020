			<h2>The Chicago Cultural Center</h2>
			<p>The <em>Chicago Cultural Center</em> is a Chicago Landmark building, opened in 1897 and operated by Chicago's 
		Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events. It houses the city's official reception venue where 
		the Mayor of Chicago has welcomed Presidents and royalty, diplomats and community leaders. It is located 
		in the Loop, across Michigan Avenue from Millennium Park. Originally the central library building, it was 
		converted in 1977 to an arts and culture center. The city's central library is now housed across the Loop 
		in the spacious, postmodern Harold Washington Library Center which opened in 1991.</p>
			<p>The Chicago Cultural Center building was designed by Boston architectural firm Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge 
		for the city's central library in 1892.It was completed in 1897 at a cost of nearly $2 million (equivalent 
		to $61.46 million in 2019). There is a 4-story north wing and a 5-story south wing, and is 104 feet tall, 
		with 3-foot-thick (0.91 m) masonry walls faced with Bedford Blue Limestone on a granite base. It was designed in a 
		generally neoclassical style with Italian Renaissance elements, and capped with two stained-glass domes, set 
		symmetrically atop the two wings.</p>
