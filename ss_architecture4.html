			<h2>The Chicago Theatre</h2>
			<p>The <em>Chicago Theatre</em>, originally known as the Balaban and Katz Chicago Theatre, is a landmark theater located on 
			North State Street in the Loop area of Chicago. Built in 1921, it was the flagship for the Balaban and Katz (B&K) group of theaters. 
			From 1925 to 1945, the Chicago Theatre was a dominant movie theater enterprise. Currently, Madison Square Garden, Inc. owns and operates 
			the Chicago Theatre as a performing arts venue for stage plays, magic shows, comedy, speeches, sporting events and popular music.</p>
			<p>The Chicago Theatre structure is seven stories tall and fills nearly one half of a city block. The 60-foot wide by six-story tall 
			triumphal arch motif of the State Street façade has been journalistically compared to the l'Arc de Triomphe in Paris. The central arch-headed 
			window adapts the familiar motif of Borromini's false-perspective window reveals of the top floor of Palazzo Barberini in Rome. The coat of 
			arms of the B&K chain — two horses holding ribbons of 35 mm film in their mouths outlined by a border of film reels — is set inside a 
			circular Tiffany stained glass window inside the arch. The exterior of the building is covered in off-white architectural 
			terracotta with Neo-Baroque stucco designs. Its interior shows French Baroque influence from the Second French Empire. The grand lobby, 
			five stories high and surrounded by gallery promenades at the mezzanine and balcony levels, is influence by the Royal Chapel at Versailles. 
			The grand staircase is patterned from the grand stair of the Paris Opera House and ascends to the various balcony levels. In 2004, the 
			original marquee was donated to the Smithsonian Institution and is featured in numerous movies and TV shows set in Chicago, and its neon 
			font was used in the title of the 2002 film Chicago. The theatre is also known for its grand Wurlitzer pipe organ, also known as "The Mighty
			Wurlitzer" and could imitate the instruments of an orchestra. It is one of the oldest Mighty Wurlitzers still in existence.</p>
