			<h2>The Railway Exchange Building</h2>
			<p>The <em>Railway Exchange Building</em> is a standout on Michigan Avenue, with its gleaming white facade commanding attention. 
		 The building was originally built as a railway exchange for the Santa Fe railway and is also known as Santa Fe Building. 
		 It is a 17-story office building in the Historic Michigan Boulevard District of the Loop. It was designed by Frederick P. 
		 Dinkelberg of D. H. Burnham & Company in the Chicago style. Dinkelberg was also the associate designer to Daniel Burnham 
		 for the Flatiron Building in New York City.</p>
			<p>The building is recognizable by the large "Motorola" logo on the roof, which is visible from Grant Park across Michigan 
		 Ave and from Lake Michigan. It is also notable for the round, porthole-like windows along the cornice. The center of the 
		 building features a lightwell, which was covered with a skylight in the 1980s. A street level two-story enclosed court 
		 designed in a symmetrical Beaux-Arts style was surmounted by the open lightwell which was surrounded by a ring of offices. 
		 By the formal arched entrance, a large staircase led to shops and a second-floor balcony. White-glazed terracotta sheaths 
		 the exterior fa√ßade and interior court and the lightwell is lined with white-glazed brick. Classical designs were used for 
		 the ornamental dentils, balusters, and column capitals. The building is completely steel-framed. In July 2012, the Santa Fe 
		 sign was replaced with an illuminated Motorola sign when Motorola Solutions began a lease on one floor of the building. 
		 The Santa Fe letters were given to the Illinois Railway Museum, where it is on display since 2016.</p>
			<p>The building is significant as a historic site because it is the where Daniel Burnham and his staff made the 1909 Plan of 
		 Chicago, a visionary Progressive Era proposal that sought to beautify Chicago and improve efficiency of commerce.</p>
