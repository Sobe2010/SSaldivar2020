		<h1>Chicago's Architecture</h1>
		<p>Chicago have influenced and reflected the history of American architecture with its buildings 
	  and architecture. The built environment of Chicago is reflective of the city's history and multicultural 
	  heritage, featuring prominent buildings in a variety of styles by many important architects. Since most 
	  structures within the downtown area were destroyed by the Great Chicago Fire in 1871, with the exception 
	  of the Water Tower, Chicago buildings are noted for their originality rather than their antiquity. Chicago 
	  is world-famous for its overabundance of unique architectural styles, from Chicago Bungalows and Two-Flats 
	  to the grand Graystones along Logan Boulevard and Lawndale Avenue, from the skyscrapers of the Loop as well 
	  as a wealth of sacred architecture such as the city's ornate "Polish Cathedrals". From the many historical 
	  buildings in Chicago, I will mention a few of my favorites, here.</p>
